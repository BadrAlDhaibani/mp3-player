# XMB MP3 Player

A small desktop MP3 player with a **PlayStation 3 XMB** skin. Point it at a folder,
browse the `.mp3` files in it, play them — and warp the audio into **nightcore**
(sped up, pitched up) or **daycore** (slowed down, pitched down) live with a slider.

This file is the project's memory and **the single source of truth for status**.
If a box below isn't ticked, it isn't done.

## v1 scope

**In:** pick a folder · browse its tracks · play/pause/next/prev/seek · live speed
slider with Nightcore/Normal/Daycore presets · XMB look · synthesized UI sounds.

**Deliberately out of v1** — good ideas, parked until v1 actually ships:
ID3 tags & album art · spectrum visualizer · shuffle/repeat/queue · export to file ·
subfolder recursion · multiple library folders.

## Decisions log

Each row is settled. Don't re-litigate — if a decision needs to change, change it
here and write down why.

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| **Live effect, not rendered files** | Dragging the speed slider must change what you hear *right now*. |
| **Pitch linked to speed** | That *is* nightcore. Plain resampling — no time-stretch, no pitch preservation. |
| **We own the audio path** (decode → numpy → PortAudio) | `QMediaPlayer.setPlaybackRate()` delegates to Windows Media Foundation, which *preserves* pitch — the exact opposite of what we want. |
| **PS3 XMB theme** | Crossbar + wave background + glossy panels. Its structure maps naturally onto a music player. |
| **UI sounds synthesized in code** | Sony's XMB sounds are their copyrighted assets. numpy-generated blips are free, tunable, and add no binary files to git. |
| **Frameless window, mouse + keyboard** | Console look to the edges, but still usable as a normal desktop app. |
| **One folder, top-level `.mp3` only** | Smallest thing that's genuinely useful. Recursion is a post-v1 add. |
| **Qt Widgets, 100% Python** | Novelty-scale project; one language beats the last 15% of polish. Reversible — see the `core/` rule below. |
| **`soundfile` as the decoder** | Verified in Batch 0: libsndfile 1.2.2 ships `MP3 = MPEG-1/2 Audio`. No ffmpeg needed. |
| **WASAPI output, device mix rate, blocksize 512** | Measured in Batch 0: MME 186 ms, DirectSound 240 ms, **WASAPI 22 ms**. Anything above ~50 ms makes UI blips feel disconnected from the keypress. |
| **Stream sample rate is negotiated, not fixed** | WASAPI shared mode only accepts the device's mix rate (48 kHz here, not 44.1). Costs nothing — the file's rate is folded into the resample ratio anyway. |
| **Dev launcher runs live source; `.exe` only at v1** | PyInstaller with PySide6 is 80–150 MB and 30–60 s per build — rebuilding after every edit would dominate development. A shortcut pointing at `pythonw.exe` gives the same double-click feel with zero rebuild cost. |
| **Two launchers: `run.bat` (console) + shortcut (no console)** | The console is worth having while debugging — tracebacks and prints go somewhere visible. The shortcut is for the real-app feel. Same live source behind both. |
| **`Mixer` is split out of `AudioEngine`** | The callback body is where every subtle bug will live (fades, seek timing, end-of-track), and it needed to be testable block-by-block with no device, no threads and no real time. `AudioEngine` is left as a thin shell over PortAudio. Batch 2: 41 offline tests against `Mixer`, none needing a sound card. |
| **End of track is polled, not pushed** | The roadmap said "end-of-track callback", but the conventions forbid calling anything from the audio thread. The callback sets a flag; `take_finished()` reports it once to the 30 Hz poll. No callable is exposed at all — a footgun nobody needs. |
| **Seeks are serial-tagged, not consume-and-clear** | A slider drag posts a stream of seeks. If the audio thread cleared the request slot, a seek posted microseconds later could be dropped. The audio thread only ever *reads* the slot and records which serial it applied, so the last seek always wins. |
| **Tracks fade out at their own end** | Files do not reliably end on silence. Running off the end and zero-filling is itself a step — the first thing Batch 2's tests caught. `resample` reports how many frames were real; the voice ramps the last 10 ms down to meet the silence. |
| **Non-MP3 files are skipped, not listed** | ~8% of this library's `.mp3` files are actually MP4/AAC (YouTube downloads with the wrong extension). libsndfile can't decode AAC, and adding PyAV (~35 MB) isn't worth it for a novelty app. `scan_folder()` sniffs magic bytes and drops anything that isn't real MP3. Revisit post-v1 if the missing 8% becomes annoying. |

### Open questions

*None currently.*

## Architecture

The one rule that keeps this honest: **`core/` never imports Qt.** It's plain
Python, testable without a display, and it's what makes the Widgets choice
reversible.

```
mp3player/
  core/                  # zero Qt imports -- enforceable seam
    models.py            # Track dataclass
    formats.py           # magic-byte sniffing; no numpy, no decoding
    library.py           # scan_folder(path) -> ScanResult(tracks, skipped)
    settings.py          # JSON at %APPDATA%/XMBPlayer/settings.json
    audio/
      decode.py          # load_audio(path) -> (float32[n,2], sr)
      dsp.py             # resample(), Fader, fade_out_at() -- pure numpy
      engine.py          # Mixer (the callback, no device) + AudioEngine (the stream)
      sfx.py             # synthesized UI sounds -> numpy arrays
  ui/                    # all Qt
    theme.py             # colors, fonts, metrics -- single source of truth
    controller.py        # PlayerController(QObject): binds core <-> ui
    chrome.py            # frameless drag/resize/min/close
    main_window.py
    widgets/             # wave.py, crossbar.py, item_column.py, transport.py
  app.py                 # entrypoint
spike/                   # throwaway Batch 0 proofs, kept for reference
tools/                   # dev harnesses -- runnable, kept, not shipped
tests/                   # core only, no display needed
```

### How the audio works

**One always-on output stream**, opened at launch, outputting silence when nothing
plays. It mixes the **music voice** (the decoded track, read at a variable rate)
with **N one-shot SFX voices** (UI blips at native rate). One device, no contention.

**Whole file decoded into memory** as `float32[n, 2]`. A 4-minute track is ~62 MB —
fine for one track at a time, and it makes seeking a pointer move and resampling a
fractional index lookup. Streaming decode is a post-v1 option if memory ever matters.

**Resampling** is a fractional read position with linear interpolation:

```python
ratio = speed * (file_sr / stream_sr)   # sample-rate conversion, free
idx   = pos + np.arange(frames) * ratio
i0    = idx.astype(np.int64)
frac  = (idx - i0)[:, None]
out   = samples[i0] * (1 - frac) + samples[i0 + 1] * frac
pos  += frames * ratio
```

Because `pos` is a float advanced continuously, **`speed` can be reassigned at any
moment and the audio follows seamlessly.** That's the whole trick. Verified in
Batch 0: 440 Hz in → 572 Hz at 1.30x, 352 Hz at 0.80x, zero discontinuities.

Known and accepted: speeding up without an anti-alias filter aliases content above
~17 kHz. Every nightcore edit on the internet does exactly this. Not fixing it in v1.

**Every gain change goes through a `Fader`** — play, pause, seek, track change,
volume drag. A gain that jumps puts a vertical edge in the waveform, and that edge
is the click. A seek can't just move `pos`: the callback fades the music out
first, jumps on the block where the gain reaches zero, then fades back in — about
21 ms, inaudible as a delay, silent as a transition.

## Conventions

Patterns worth keeping. When something works, it goes here and gets reused — we
don't invent a second way to do a thing we've already solved.

- **`core/` imports no Qt.** Ever. This is the seam; guard it.
- **`float32[n_frames, 2]` is the canonical audio buffer** everywhere. Mono is
  upmixed at decode time so nothing downstream has to think about channel counts.
- **The audio callback must not block, allocate wildly, or touch Qt.** No locks.
  `speed`/`volume` are plain float attributes (assignment is atomic under the GIL);
  seeks are posted as a `pending_seek` attribute the callback consumes.
- **The UI polls the engine at 30 Hz via `QTimer`** — never emit a Qt signal from
  the audio thread.
- **Sniff file types by magic bytes, never trust the extension.** 8% of this
  library's `.mp3` files aren't MP3.
- **Fade ~10 ms on every transition** (play/pause/seek/track change) to stay
  click-free.
- **Speed and pitch are linked by design.** If you're ever tempted to add
  time-stretch, that's a decisions-log change, not an implementation detail.

## Roadmap

Tracer-bullet order: validate the riskiest thing first, reach a working-but-ugly
end-to-end player early, then layer polish onto something that already functions.

**Working agreement:** one batch at a time. Each batch ends in something runnable.
At the end of a batch, tick these boxes, report what's done and what's left, and
**stop for sign-off before starting the next.** No building ahead.

### Batch 0 — Foundations & spike ✅

- [x] Rewrite `requirements.txt` as UTF-8 (was UTF-16); add numpy, sounddevice, soundfile
- [x] Verify `soundfile` decodes real `.mp3` → numpy (libsndfile 1.2.2, MP3 present)
- [x] Verify `sounddevice` playback through a callback stream
- [x] Verify nightcore/daycore resampling — pitch tracks speed exactly, no clicks
- [x] Lock the decoder choice (`soundfile`; MP3 *encoding* also available, so post-v1 export is free)
- [x] Pick the output backend (WASAPI @ device rate, blocksize 512, 22 ms)
- [x] Create `CLAUDE.md`
- [x] Create the package skeleton

### Batch 1 — Core: library & settings ✅

- [x] `models.py` — `Track` dataclass
- [x] `formats.py` — magic-byte sniffing, split out so `library` and `decode` share it
- [x] `library.py` — `scan_folder()`, top-level `.mp3`, sorted, magic-byte sniffing,
      tolerant of missing / empty / unreadable folders
- [x] `settings.py` — JSON round-trip at `%APPDATA%/XMBPlayer/`, sane defaults,
      atomic write, survives a corrupt or hand-edited file
- [x] Tests for both — 54 passing

Verified against the real library: `~/Music` 31 playable / 6 skipped,
`~/Downloads` 199 playable / 14 skipped — matching the Batch 0 survey exactly.

### Batch 2 — Core: audio engine ✅

- [x] `decode.py` — `load_audio()` → `float32[n,2]` + sample rate, mono upmixed,
      surround folded, every failure a `DecodeError`
- [x] `dsp.py` — `resample()`, `Fader`, `fade_out_at()`
- [x] `engine.py` — always-on stream, music voice, transport, live speed, volume,
      end-of-track (polled, not pushed), device negotiation
- [x] `sfx.py` — synthesized blips + `play_sfx()` into a fixed voice pool on the
      same stream
- [x] Tests for `decode`, `dsp`, `sfx` **and `Mixer`** — 120 new, 174 total
- [x] `tools/engine_harness.py` — keyboard-driven, no Qt

Verified on hardware: WASAPI @ 48 kHz, 22 ms, zero underruns. A 44.1 kHz file
plays at correct pitch and duration through the 48 kHz stream; speed reassigned
mid-playback tracked 1.27x against a requested 1.30x over a half-second window.

### Batch 3 — Ugly working player

- [ ] **First:** `run.bat` (console, for debugging) + `XMB Player` desktop shortcut
      via `pythonw.exe` (no console) — both run the live source, no build step
- [ ] `controller.py` — `PlayerController(QObject)`, signals, 30 Hz position poll
- [ ] Plain window: folder picker, `QListWidget`, transport buttons, seek + speed sliders
- [ ] Everything wired: play / pause / next / prev / seek / speed
- [ ] Folder and volume remembered across launches

### Batch 4 — XMB shell: structure

- [ ] `theme.py` — palette, fonts, metrics
- [ ] `chrome.py` — frameless window, `startSystemMove`/`startSystemResize`, F11
- [ ] `crossbar.py` + `item_column.py` — three categories, keyboard *and* mouse nav
- [ ] Transport strip restyled into the bottom bar
- [ ] Swap the ugly window out; identical controller underneath

### Batch 5 — XMB shell: motion & atmosphere

- [ ] `wave.py` — sine ribbons, additive glow, half-res pixmap upscale, fps cap
- [ ] Slide + fade animations on category and item change
- [ ] Glow / scale on the selected item
- [ ] Perf pass — idle CPU with the wave running

### Batch 6 — Sound & feel

- [ ] Hook `move` / `confirm` / `back` / `error` / `startup` to navigation
- [ ] Tune the synthesized sounds by ear
- [ ] Click-free fades on every transition
- [ ] Easing curve tuning

### Batch 7 — Ship v1

- [ ] Error handling: empty folder, deleted folder, corrupt mp3, no audio device
- [ ] First-run experience when no folder has been chosen yet
- [ ] `README.md` with run instructions
- [ ] PyInstaller build → standalone `.exe` (distribution only; dev still runs live source)
- [ ] Final `CLAUDE.md` status pass
- [ ] Tag v1

## Reference numbers

Measured on this machine (Realtek headphones, Windows 11), Batch 0:

| Host API | Latency @ 48 kHz |
|---|---|
| MME (PortAudio default) | 186 ms |
| DirectSound | 240 ms |
| **WASAPI** | **22 ms** (blocksize ≤ 512) |
| WDM-KS | device unavailable |

WASAPI shared mode rejects any rate but the device mix rate (48000 here).
